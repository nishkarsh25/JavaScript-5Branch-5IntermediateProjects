# Form Validation

Welcome to the Form Validation project! This project focuses on creating a robust and user-friendly form validation mechanism to ensure that user input meets specified criteria. By leveraging HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, this project delivers an interactive and responsive form validation experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Input Validation
- The form validates multiple input fields, including:
  - **Username**: Must not be empty.
  - **Email**: Must be in a valid email format.
  - **Password**: Must be at least 8 characters long.
  - **Confirm Password**: Must match the entered password.

### 2. Real-time Feedback
- Users receive immediate feedback as they interact with the form. Error messages dynamically appear below each input field when the input is invalid, aiding users in identifying and rectifying errors promptly.

### 3. Visual Indicators
- Valid and invalid inputs are visually distinguished to provide clear cues to users. Valid inputs are highlighted with a green border, while invalid inputs are highlighted with a red border, facilitating easy identification of input status.

### 4. Interactive Experience
- The form offers an engaging and interactive experience, allowing users to witness real-time feedback as they type. This dynamic feedback loop enhances user engagement and streamlines the form-filling process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of the form, including input fields and error messages.
- **CSS (with Tailwind CSS)**: Provides styling for the form elements, such as layout, colors, and typography. Tailwind CSS simplifies styling and ensures a consistent design system.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for validating user inputs and updating the form's visual feedback based on validation results. JavaScript enhances interactivity and enriches the user experience.

## How to Use

Using the Form Validation is straightforward:

1. **Fill out the Form**: Enter your information into the provided input fields.
2. **Validation**: As you type, the form dynamically validates each input field.
3. **Feedback**: Receive immediate feedback on input validity through error or success messages and color highlighting.
4. **Submission**: Once all inputs are valid, you can submit the form successfully.
