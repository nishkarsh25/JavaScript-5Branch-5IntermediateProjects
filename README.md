# Typing Game Without Backspace

Welcome to the Typing Game Without Backspace project! This project is a web-based typing game designed to test and improve your typing speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional typing games, this game introduces a unique challenge by disabling the backspace key, encouraging players to focus on typing each character correctly the first time.

## How to Play

1. **Start Typing**: Begin typing the displayed paragraph in the input field provided. The paragraph will be displayed one character at a time, with the next character highlighted.
2. **No Backspace**: There is no option to use the backspace key for corrections. Focus on typing each character correctly without making mistakes.
3. **Monitor Progress**: Track your progress in real-time with the provided metrics:
   - **Time Left**: Displays the remaining time in seconds. The game has a time limit of 60 seconds.
   - **Mistakes**: Shows the number of mistakes made during typing.
   - **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Calculates your typing speed in words per minute based on the characters typed.
   - **Characters Per Minute (CPM)**: Measures your typing speed in characters per minute.
4. **Try Again**: After completing the paragraph or when time runs out, click the "Try Again" button to reset the game and attempt to improve your performance.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Each time you start the game or click "Try Again," a random paragraph is generated for typing practice. This ensures a fresh experience with every play.
- **Real-Time Metrics**: The game provides real-time updates on your typing speed and accuracy, allowing you to monitor your progress as you type.
- **Time Limit**: With a time limit of 60 seconds, players are challenged to type as much of the paragraph as possible within the given time frame.
- **Responsive Design**: The game interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across various devices and screen sizes.
